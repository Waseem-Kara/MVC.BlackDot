# MVC.BlackDot


MVC .net core 5 app

Unfinished work due to time constraints:
 * document summary download is not working and will not download a document with the selected sources
 * more options such as allowing the user to select which search engines they want to use along with page size
 * more unit test coverage

Please use the master branch for the latest changes

If there is any trouble running the app try running it in project mode not in IIS Express also please allow any SSL certs it might ask you to allow when debugging

Thanks
